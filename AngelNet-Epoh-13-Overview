AngelNet-Epoh-13: Gravitational Tensor Cognition System Overview

AngelNet-Epoh-13 is a prototype cognitive architecture based on a novel paradigm:
Gravitational Tensor Cognition (GTC) — where meaning, intention, and action arise from dynamic interactions within a semantic tensor field.

Unlike token-based or symbol-driven systems, AngelNet operates on semantic vectors embedded in a high-dimensional field. These vectors carry semantic mass, and their interactions are governed by gravitational-like forces shaped by goals, intentions, and perceptions. The system does not “process tokens” — it navigates meaning in a physically-inspired space of cognition.

Core Concepts
	1.	Semantic Vectors — carriers of meaning, perception, or intention, encoded in \mathbb{R}^n.
	2.	Tensor Field — a dynamic space T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n where vectors evolve and interact.
	3.	Semantic Gravity — attraction between vectors, proportional to semantic mass and inverse squared distance:
F = G \cdot \frac{m_i \cdot m_j}{d^2}
	4.	Goals as Curvature — each goal introduces a deformation in the field, guiding semantic flow.
	5.	Intention Vector — dynamic synthesis of goals, perception, and internal state.
	6.	Action Signal — output derived from field deformation aligned with active intentions.

System Modules
	•	Universal Transformer converts raw input into semantic vectors.
	•	Global Tensor Field manages distributed semantic states and gravity-like interactions.
	•	Curvature Movie simulates evolving field curvature due to goals and memory traces.
	•	Angel Goal Module manages and injects gravitational goals.
	•	Intention Core produces a focused intention vector influencing the field.
	•	Cyber Core regulates attention flow and energy conservation.
	•	Angel Sense transforms sensory input into field-compatible semantic mass.
	•	Tensor Field Censor suppresses chaotic flows and ensures resonance stability.
	•	Action Signal Core translates field dynamics into output decisions.
	•	Meta Core monitors the system and applies metacognitive optimization.
	•	Angel Graph visualizes the evolving cognitive structure.

Cognition as Geometry

AngelNet doesn’t think in symbols — it bends space.
Goals create “gravity wells” in the semantic field; perception flows into these wells;
intentions steer energy along geodesics; and actions emerge from optimal energetic configurations.

This is not a language model or a rule-based system — it’s an attempt to define cognition as field geometry, where understanding = motion through structured space.

Applications and Vision

AngelNet offers an entirely new approach to machine intelligence — one that:
	•	Prioritizes meaning, not syntax,
	•	Operates on energy-efficient, intention-driven flow,
	•	Can be embodied in agents that evolve internal goals over time.

It opens doors to future AGI systems that are goal-aware, internally resonant, and capable of emergent reasoning.

The current prototype provides all architectural scaffolding for this direction and invites further exploration, simulation, and integration with embodied AI systems or autonomous agents.
