The action_signal.py module governs the translation of internal semantic field dynamics into actionable signals. It effectively bridges the cognitive field with the agent’s behavioral output system.

Key functions:
	•	Extracting field distortions and gradients near current intention trajectories.
	•	Converting this data into abstract motor signals or decision outputs a_t via:

a_t = \text{Decode}\left( \arg\max_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{A}} \, \nabla T(\mathbf{x}) \cdot \mathbf{I} \right)

where \mathcal{A} is the action space, and \mathbf{I} is the intention vector.
	•	Prioritizing actions with the highest alignment to intention and lowest energetic cost.
	•	Updating the system’s belief state based on action feedback.

This module ensures the loop from goal → intention → action is closed through physical or symbolic output. While abstract in current prototype form, it is foundational for future embodiment in robotics or interface systems.
