The angel_goal_module.py is responsible for managing the agent’s internal system of goals, which are treated not as symbolic instructions but as gravitational sources that reshape the semantic tensor field.

Each goal is encoded as a semantic vector \mathbf{g}_i \in \mathbb{R}^n with associated mass and priority. The module maintains an active set of goals \mathcal{G}, each introducing localized curvature into the field. The effect is formalized as:

\mathcal{K}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{\mathbf{g}_i \in \mathcal{G}} \frac{m(\mathbf{g}_i)}{d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{g}_i)^2} \cdot P(\mathbf{g}_i)

This curvature alters the geodesic paths of semantic flow, encouraging efficient movement of attention and intention toward relevant areas.

The module also performs:
	•	Goal evaluation and decay,
	•	Reweighting based on sensory resonance,
	•	Injection of new goals into the field.

Ultimately, this module is the primary driver of tensor field deformation, representing cognitive will in geometric form.
