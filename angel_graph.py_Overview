angel_graph.py
The angel_graph.py module constructs and maintains a dynamic semantic-intentional graph based on interactions between goals, vectors, and actions within the tensor field.

Each node in the graph represents:
	•	A semantic vector (concept, perception, or action),
	•	Or a goal/intention structure.

Edges encode:
	•	Influence (gravitational, intentional),
	•	Temporal sequences,
	•	Semantic resonance.

This graph provides an externalized representation of cognitive structure:

G = (V, E), \quad E = \{ (\mathbf{v}_i, \mathbf{v}j, w{ij}) \}

Where w_{ij} reflects gravitational pull or co-activation resonance.

The module supports:
	•	Visualization of semantic flows,
	•	Extraction of influence pathways,
	•	Detection of cognitive bottlenecks or dead ends.

angel_graph.py allows researchers or agents to inspect and debug cognitive topology in real time, creating a window into the otherwise invisible dynamics of Tensor Gravity Cognition.
