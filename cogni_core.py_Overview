The cogni_core.py file defines the foundational cognitive engine of AngelNet-Epoh-13. Known as the Cognitive Core, this module is responsible for managing and evolving the global semantic tensor field that underpins the agent’s perception, memory, and decision-making processes.

Inside cogni_core.py, the core tasks include:
	•	Maintaining the Tensor Field, a dynamic space where semantic vectors live and interact.
	•	Applying gravitational forces between vectors based on semantic mass and proximity (Tensor Gravity mechanism).
	•	Updating the curvature of the field according to active goals, effectively reshaping semantic trajectories.
	•	Integrating sensory inputs from Angel Sense and transforming them into semantic updates.

The Cognitive Core also handles energy conservation principles within the field, ensuring that the agent’s reasoning follows geodesic paths (minimal energy routes) defined by the local curvature induced by goals.

This module is essential because it operationalizes the idea of cognition as field dynamics, allowing for emergent, meaning-driven behavior rather than rigid token-based responses. It bridges semantic mass, gravitational interaction, and field deformation into a unified operational structure.
