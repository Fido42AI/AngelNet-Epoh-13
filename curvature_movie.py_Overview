The curvature_movie.py module defines the evolution of curvature over time in the semantic tensor field. It simulates how goals reshape the geometry of cognition dynamically, forming new attractors and dissipating outdated intentions.

This module:
	•	Maintains a time-indexed record of curvature tensors \mathcal{K}_t,
	•	Propagates curvature changes across the field through a diffusion-like model:

\mathcal{K}_{t+1}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathcal{K}_t(\mathbf{x}) + \Delta t \cdot D \nabla^2 \mathcal{K}_t(\mathbf{x}) + S(\mathbf{x}, t)

Where:
	•	D is a diffusion constant,
	•	S(\mathbf{x}, t) represents sources (active goals),
	•	\nabla^2 is the Laplacian operator over the tensor space.

The curvature field affects geodesics of meaning and alters the semantic gravity landscape. The result is a temporal “movie” of mental topology shifts.

This module allows the system to track long-term motivational topography and adapt to persistent environmental or internal stimuli, encoding memory-like traces in field shape.
