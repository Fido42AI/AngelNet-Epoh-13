The cyber_core.py module defines the Cybernetic Core, a subsystem responsible for regulating the agent’s internal control logic, attention focus, and field-level resource balancing. It bridges low-level field dynamics with goal-aligned action potential, operating analogously to a nervous system regulating energetic flow within a body.

Key features of this module include:
	•	Tracking the energetic budget of the semantic field.
	•	Dynamically shifting “focus sectors” of cognition toward areas of high curvature or gravity.
	•	Suppressing or enhancing regions of the tensor field via feedback loops.

Mathematically, this module acts as a control function C(t) over the field evolution:

\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \mathcal{F}(T, \mathcal{K}, F) + C(t)

where C(t) may amplify or dampen certain trajectories based on cognitive resonance or urgency encoded in the Intention Core.

The Cyber Core also plays a vital role in resource minimization, redirecting semantic flow to reduce unnecessary processing by optimizing cognitive path length:

\text{Effort} = \int_{\gamma} \left( \frac{1}{\|\mathbf{v}_{\text{goal}} - \mathbf{v}_t\| + \epsilon} \right) dt

This module ensures the cognitive system remains economical, efficient, and coherent under changing sensory and goal-driven perturbations.
