intention_core.py defines the Intention Core, which serves as the agent’s inner motivational engine. Its role is to synthesize active goals, recent perceptions, and internal field states into focused intention vectors.

Key operations include:
	•	Generating an active intention vector \mathbf{I} \in \mathbb{R}^n as a weighted combination of current goals and field curvature gradients.
	•	Adjusting intention flow in real-time based on system resonance and goal proximity.
	•	Projecting intention back into the field as an influencing force:

\mathbf{F}_{\text{int}} = \nabla \cdot \left( m(\mathbf{I}) \cdot \frac{1}{d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{I})^2} \right)

This force reshapes the semantic field locally, allowing the agent to selectively amplify or suppress meaning vectors aligned or misaligned with its intention.

The Intention Core embodies directional cognition: it aligns the semantic dynamics of the agent with its current motivational configuration.
