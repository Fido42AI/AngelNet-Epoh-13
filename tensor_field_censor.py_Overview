The tensor_field_censor.py module introduces regulation and stability control mechanisms into the dynamic tensor field. In highly adaptive systems, meaning chaos can occur—this module prevents semantic overload, noise propagation, and unstable resonance patterns.

Its core functions:
	•	Monitor entropy across regions of the tensor field.
	•	Suppress unstable or unresonant semantic flows.
	•	Apply threshold-based clipping, damping, or rerouting of vector forces.

Formally, the censor operates a constraint function:

\mathbf{v}{\prime} =
\begin{cases}
\mathbf{v}, & \text{if } \| \mathbf{v} \| < \tau \text{ and } R(\mathbf{v}) > \rho \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}

Where:
	•	\tau is a vector magnitude threshold,
	•	R(\mathbf{v}) is a resonance function measuring phase alignment,
	•	\rho is the minimum resonance tolerance.

This module is essential for semantic hygiene — ensuring the field evolves meaningfully and coherently.
